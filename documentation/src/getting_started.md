# Getting Started

I see you've decided to become even sillier. BIG mistake.

## 1) Download SillyScript

You can download SillyScript once I create SillyScript.

## 2) Create some SillyScript code

Save the following code into a file named `list.silly`:
```SillyScript
1;
"This is a string";
false;
```

## 3) Convert your script to data

Finally, you can run the SillyScript executable to convert the script into a data format.
```
silly <script file path> <output file path>
```

So like this:
```
silly list.silly output.json
```
